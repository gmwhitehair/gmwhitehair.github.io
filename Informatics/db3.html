<h1> Database 3 </h1>
<ul>
<li> <b> What are the common types of problems with data? </b> Some of the major problems with data are duplicates, incomplete data, inconsistent formats, accessibility, system upgrades, and data purging and storage. Most of these can be solved by using queries but major corporations are definitely afraid of these problems and have ran into them before. <a href: "https://analyticsindiamag.com/6-major-data-quality-issues-haunt-almost-major-organisations/"> Link to Source. </a> </li>
<li> <b> What was the hardest type of data problem to clean for you? </b> The hardest type of data to clean for me was probably the <q>IS NULL</q> statements. I though it was <q>IF NULL</q> and I had to go back in the video. But, I have taken K-201 in Kelley and that was all about Access so the things we did were relatively easy for me. </li>
<li> <b> How comfortable do you feel about cleaning data sets? (1–5 :: 1 == highly uncomfortable, 5 == quite comfortable) </b> I’d say I’m at about a 4. I am extremely familiar with Access because of K201 but I am not entirely familiar with the SQL view feature, just the design view feature. </li>
