<div class = "paragraph"> Using the skills from I101 using Microsoft Access, I have begun the process of creating a database for our clients. Some of the attributes in the customer table include phone number (primary key), name, address, cost, and notes. Then I have two more tables, Small Gardens and Big Gardens. Small Gardens are gardens under $100 and Big Gardens are the ones over $100. Phone numbers are used as foreign keys in both of those tables. This database will be very helpful and according to Daniel Pepper in How to Start and Grow Your Lawn Care Maintenance Business, “will help you retain customers for years to come” (Pepper 283). </div>

<div class = "paragraph"> Using the Google Forms survey, I will be more easily able to collect customer information. We will gain further insight into the marketing strategies that work. We will be able to update phone numbers and addresses. We will get more recommendations from customers. According to Pepper, “you have to be able to be your own customer and recognize your needs” (Pepper 284). This survey will help us do that. </div>

Unfortunately, it may be time to abandon our Facebook campaign. We tried something and it did not work, as shown in our google form survey. It is costing us too much money. But what is working is our Craigslist campaign. On the left is our old Craigslist ad and on the right is our revised craigslist ad that I put together for the purposes of this project. I think with this better marketing strategy that tells more about the business we will get more hits. Also, to tie into this marketing strategy of hitting areas of high volume of gardeners, we will place our garden signs at home and garden retail locations – dotted on the map below – instead of just randomly around town. All of these things put together will certainly help our marketing strategy.
