<h1> Python 3 </h1>
<p> 1. While Loop Syntax: In the example below, I laid out what a while loop syntax might look like. The "i" variable initializes a counter variable. The "while <= 5" means the program will continue to run when the counter variable, "i", is less than 5. The "print(i)" will print the numbers. And the "i += 1" will add a 1 every time the program runs through. Notice the colon and the indention. The code will not run without these things. The "while True:" is a different while loop that allows the user to loop as long there isn't a "break" statement in the code. </p> 



<p> 2. A good use of the remove function may be to remove a string or an integer from a list. For example, in the "Python 3" code hyperlinked below, I used a remove function to remove a number when it was guessed in my list. </p>
