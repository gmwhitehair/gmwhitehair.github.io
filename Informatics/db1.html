	<li> <b>What are primary keys:</b> Primary Keys are a unique value that represents a whole row. Every row or tuple will be differentiated by the primary key. An example of a primary key would be everyone’s student ID numbers at IU. </li>
	<li> <b>What are foreign keys:</b> Foreign Keys are a type of key that exists in one table but refers to a primary key in another table allowing us to link tables together. </li>
	<li> <b>What is the difference between a tuple and an attribute:</b> Each table is composed of two main elements: Attributes (Columns) and Tuples (Rows). A tuple is a row in a table, it is also known as a record. Its order does not matter. Attributes are column headings that describe the data of each column in a relational table. All the attributes together make up the “Schema” which is the description of the relation. </li>
	<li> <b>What is SQL? (What does it stand for and what does it do?):</b> SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a bunch of short lines of code grouped together that executes some form of function or action on our databases. SQL is the standard language for Relational Database Management Systems. </li>
	<li> <b> Provide an example of something that could be use as a primary key (do NOT use the example from the slides) and explain why you chose that:</b> In a Database class called K-201 in the business school, we used often used Access. One of our example projects was for Kroger and the databases they have. They use primary keys for all their members in the form of "Customer ID's." These customer ID's are a numerical code that represents each member and is printed on the back of their membership card. This primary key allows Kroger to easily look up each member. </li>
