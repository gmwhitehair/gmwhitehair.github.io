For instance, take the two words "fuming" and "furious." Make up your
mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you
will first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline
ever so little towards "fuming," you will say "fuming-furious;" if
they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards "furious," you will say
"furious-fuming;" but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly
balanced mind, you will say "frumious."
